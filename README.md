# neural_network
To enhance my understanding of neural networks, I'm attempting to build a NN by hand using only numpy trained to preform handwritten number recognition.
This is a classic example inspired by videos from 3Blue1Brown and the availability of the [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
